    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera into a spice grinder; grind to a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.</li>
        <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain; set aside</li>
        <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir and set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully transfer 1 tablespoon ghee from the pot to a small bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from marinade, wiping excess marinade off; add chicken to the pot. Discard remaining marinade. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side; spread rice on top, then sprinkle on onions. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over rice and onions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pot; cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low; continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes more.
