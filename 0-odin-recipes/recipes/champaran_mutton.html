    <h1>Champaran Mutton</h1>
    <img src = "../images/champaran.jpg"
    <p>As the name suggests, Champaran meat is a famous dish with its roots from Champaran, Bihar, India. Here, the meat is marinated in a mix of exotic species, oil, ghee, ginger paste, roasted onions and cooked in a buttery sauce, which brings rich flavours. Once all the spices are mixed, the mutton is cooked at a low flame of a wood fire and is tossed continuously to maintain the flavours. Even though no complex art or method is used for cooking Champaran Mutton, it continues to surprise with the burst of flavour in every bite. </p>

        <li>After 45 minutes, take off the dough seal and check if the mutton is cooked properly. If the oil used is floating on the upper layer, it means the mutton is well-cooked and tender.</li>
